StackPack Journey is a puzzle platform game designed to teach players about the stack data structure and its Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Players embark on a journey to reunite with their lost soulmate in a strange world. Equipped with a StackPack (a backpack that works like a stack), players must strategically collect (push) and use (pop) items scattered throughout the world to overcome obstacles and ultimately reach their soulmate. Every decision matters, as players must carefully determine exactly when to push and pop items to move forward. By mastering stack manipulation, players progress through the game while gaining a deeper understanding of the stack.

# Basic Instructions

-   Use the arrow keys to move and jump.
-   Press 'E' to PUSH (collect) an item into your StackPack. All collectable items pulsate.
-   Press 'F' to POP (use) an item from your StackPack. You can only use items in areas that light up when you go near them!
-   You can only POP (use) items from the **top** of your StackPack, so think carefully about the order you'll need to use items when you PUSH and POP. Remember: the **L**ast item you PUSH **I**n is the **F**irst item you can POP **O**ut (**LIFO**).
-   If you make a mistake, click the 'Free Pop' button in the top left to POP out items from your StackPack, but use your Free Pops sparingly, as you have a limited number of them.
-   Your goal in each level is to reach and unlock the door. Good luck!
